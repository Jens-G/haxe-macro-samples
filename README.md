Haxe Macro, Haxe Magic and Haxe Metadata code samples
==================

New with Haxe? Need a jumpstart with Haxe macros? 

Well, here we go. This project contains a bunch of samples that help you to quickly unleash the power of Haxe macros. 

Known limitations
-------------------
Note that these samples are just that - samples. They are by no means  intended to be fully featured, complete, robust and production-ready codes. 

Have fun!
